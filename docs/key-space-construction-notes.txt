Keyspace construction notes

Each key space is identified by the map or topicref that names the key scope and the ancestor key scopes.

Set of key spaces is logically hierarchical but really a set of spaces.

Need a way to hash each key space's ID in order to capture the relationships of different key spaces to each other.

On recursive descent from root map:

1. construct 1 or more key spaces: #root, any named key spaces.

   - Key space is a map of key names to key definitions.
   - Key space key is (topicrefelem, (ancestor topicref elements))
   - Key space set is an ordered sequence of key spaces, constructed in depth-first
     document order and breadth-first map order
     
2. Maintain a stack of ancestor key spaces: any topicref or map that defines
   names a key scope creates a new sequence of active key spaces and pushes it on the stack
   
3. For each new key definition, add it to the current key spaces unqualified, and to each ancestor key space qualified by the scopes from the ancestor to the key.
